# Google-Grade Client State & Browser Storage Directives

> ⚠️ **MANDATORY CLIENT STATE DIRECTIVE FOR ALL SESSIONS & AI AGENTS**
> Client state persistence across all SG Forge web interfaces and micro-apps MUST adhere to Google's **4-Tier State Hierarchy**. Arbitrary, un-namespaced `localStorage` dumps, stale view overrides on refresh, and unhandled `JSON.parse` crashes are strictly forbidden.

## 🛑 THE 7 BROWSER STATE INVARIANTS

### 1. The 4-Tier State Classification (Strict Partitioning)
Every piece of state in a web application must be placed into its correct tier:
- **Tier 1 (URL Search Params & History API)**: Active sub-tabs (`?tab=apps` or `#apps`), search queries (`?q=auth`), filter toggles, active entity IDs, and modal states. **Single source of truth for sharable, bookmarkable, and refreshable state**.
- **Tier 2 (`localStorage` with Versioned Envelopes)**: Visual theme (`dark`/`light`), sidebar collapse state, table column widths, density modes (`compact`/`comfortable`), last active workspace ID.
- **Tier 3 (`sessionStorage` for Tab Isolation)**: In-flight multi-step form data, uncommitted draft inputs, modal staging buffers, tab-scoped active states. Cleared when tab closes to prevent parallel-tab collisions.
- **Tier 4 (`IndexedDB`)**: Heavy graph datasets, offline telemetry queues, large query results.

### 2. Tier 1 URL Determinism & Anti-Stale Restoration Invariant
- **Single Source of Truth**: Active navigation tabs, filters, and entity selections MUST strictly resolve from URL parameters (`?tab=...&db=...` or `#<tab>`).
- **No Stale Storage Overwrite on Refresh**: Storage tiers (`localStorage` / `sessionStorage`) must **NEVER** override URL routes on page load or refresh.
- **Canonical Default on Clean URL**: When entering a root URL without explicit query/hash (e.g. `/devcenter` or `/portal`), the application must deterministically render the primary default view (`overview` / `canvas`), never a stale tab persisted from past sessions.
- **Cross-Window Deep Linking**: Any action that navigates to another tool (e.g. clicking "DB" or "Logs" for an app) must open `?tab=<target>&<filter>=<value>` in a new tab, allowing the target window to hydrate instantly and deterministically from the URL.

### 3. Standardized Key Namespacing & Versioning
- Storage keys MUST follow the format: `forge:v<version>:<appName>:<category>` (e.g., `forge:v1:portal:theme`, `forge:v1:devcenter:active-tab`).
- Never use un-namespaced keys like `theme`, `tab`, or `settings`.

### 4. Zero Layout Shift (FOUC Prevention)
- Critical visual variables (`data-theme`, `data-sidebar-collapsed`) MUST be restored synchronously in the HTML `<head>` using `getHeadStateScript()` from `@forge/ui` before the document body begins painting.

### 5. Zero-Throw Defensive JSON Parsing
- Raw `JSON.parse` is forbidden on client storage reads without defensive error handling.
- Always use `createStateStore` from `@forge/ui/state` or a `try/catch` fallback returning safe defaults.

### 6. Real-Time Cross-Tab Synchronization
- Global preference changes (e.g., Theme, Active Organization) must broadcast instantly across all open browser windows/tabs using `BroadcastChannel('sg_forge_state_sync_bus')` and storage events.

### 7. Zero Sensitive Data in Client Storage
- Passwords, long-lived API tokens, OAuth refresh tokens, and PII are **HARD BLOCKED** from `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. Sandboxed iframes communicate state strictly via secure `postMessage` protocol.
